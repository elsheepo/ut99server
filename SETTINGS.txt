Supported Settings:
===============================================================================

* ACEPort, bAllowOtherPorts: Refer to FIREWALL.txt

* bAutoUpdateFileList: when set to true, ACE will automatically download 
  updates for the FileList. Please note that this feature is currently disabled
  and will be reenabled when v0.9 reaches the BETA stage.
* FileListName: Name of the FileList
* FileListPath: Folder in which to look for the FileList

* SShotPath: Folder in which the screenshots should be stored
* SShotPrefix: Prefix for the screenshot file names

* LogPath: Folder in which the logs should be stored
* LogPrefix: Prefix for the log file names

* HandshakeTimeout: Time allowed for the players to complete the handshake
* InitialCheckTimeout: Time allowed for the players to complete the initial 
  check. Please note that the initial check usually takes longer to complete
  than the periodic check.
* PeriodicCheckInterval: Time between consecutive periodic checks
* PeriodicCheckTimeout: Time allowed for players to complete the periodic check
* SShotTimeout: Time allowed for players to complete sending a screenshot

* bStrictSystemLibraryChecks: When set to true, ACE will kick for patches
in system libraries. Very few cheats patch system libraries but lots of
external tools do. Thus, setting this to true may cause lots of false positives.

* bSShotWhenKick: When set to true, the gameserver will request screenshots to
  be taken when a player is kicked

* bAutoConfig: When set to true, ACE will attempt to automatically configure
  the UPackages list.
* AutoConfigPackage: Name of the AutoConfig package (without the .u extension)

* UPackages: Names of extra mods to be checked by ACE (with .u extensions)
* NativePackages: Names of extra libraries to be checked by ACE (with .dll)

* AdminPass: when configured, this adminpass can be used to take silent 
  screenshots

* bAllowCrosshairScaling: when set to true, players are allowed to change the
  rendering scale of their crosshairs. Does not work with EUT!
  
* bShowLogo: when set to true, ACE will render a logo that shows the progress
  of the initial check.
* LogoXPos: X-Offset of the logo (in pixels, relative to the left side of the 
  screen)
* LogoYPos: Y-Offset of the logo (in pixels, relative to the middle horizontal)

* bCheckSpectators: When set to true, ACE will also check spectators

* bAutoFindWANIp, bCacheWANIP, WANQueryServer: Refer to NAT.txt
